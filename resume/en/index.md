## Work Experiences

### A****, March 2023 ~ Now
In the IP-related industry, the specific details are temporarily confidential.  
We have started incorporating AI tools into the development process.
First-year management of a team of six, overcoming the challenge of innovating with limited resources, concurrently managing and enhancing existing old projects.
Achieved a significant milestone with a 30 million bonus for a startup initiative and earned ISO 27001 certification.

### Consulting and Entrepreneurship, March 2020 - Now
After leaving Jiuyi, I attempted to adjust my work style and joined various startup teams.   
These teams included international ones, where I sometimes had to work as both a developer and project manager,   
participate in shareholder meetings, engage in bidding processes or technical competitions,   
and even invest my own funds. I encountered both traditional and cutting-edge industries during this process,  
which broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of the mutual influence of software engineering and other industries.   
To supplement my income during entrepreneurship, I also continued to work part-time as a teaching assistant at a coding school,   
allowing me to gain insights from career changers from different industries and engage with young students.

#### AltiGen
Due to the team being spread across the United States (East and West coasts), the United Kingdom, Nepal, and Taiwan,   
and considering the impact of the pandemic, I participated in my first fully remote team development here.   
This mode of development required greater self-management and English communication skills.   
We primarily used Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, for development, and skills related to frontend technologies such as React.  

#### AlphaCamp
I worked remotely as a teaching assistant, primarily responsible for grading students' programming assignments and answering their questions.  
I mainly used technologies such as Node.js and MySQL.   
Students had a wide range of questions, so I needed to patiently guide them and establish standardized processes for quickly identifying errors.  
I also assisted students in completing their final projects, helping them smoothly transition into the software industry.  

#### TTFB-LAB

TTFB-LAB is a startup company in the food service industry, backed by the Vacharachai Group.   
We mainly adopted cloud-native and microservices development using the Google Cloud Platform.   
We developed features such as shopping carts, orders, payment processing, and CRM backend systems, primarily using Golang and C#.

#### CompareTech
This is a friend's insurance startup company, and my involvement was in a consulting capacity. I assisted in implementing research and development (RD) development processes.
